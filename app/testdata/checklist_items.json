The primary purpose is to track individuals for taxes and identification. A Social Security lists your name and Social Security number, and is often necessary for obtaining other items, such as a state identification card. People don't usually carry their Social Security cards with them everywhere, since they are not usually necessary on a day-to-day basis.",
